## Discount Badge
Discount Badge is a canonical component that any VTEX app can import.

To import it into your code: 
```js
import DiscountBadge from 'vtex.store-components/DiscountBadge'
```

## Usage
You can use it in your code like a React component with the jsx tag: `<DiscountBadge />`. 
```html
<DiscountBadge listPrice={commertialOffer.ListPrice}
                sellingPrice={commertialOffer.Price}
                label={badgeText}> 
  <img src="" alt="">
</DiscountBadge>
```

And it will render an image with the list of collection badges located at the bottom.
