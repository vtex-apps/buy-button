## Usage

You should follow the usage instruction in the main [README](/README.md#usage).

Then, add `logo` block into your app theme, as we do in our [Header app](https://github.com/vtex-apps/store-header/blob/master/store/blocks.json). 

### Blocks API

When implementing this component as a block, various inner blocks may be available. The following interface lists the available blocks within `Logo` and describes if they are required or optional.

```json
  "logo": {
    "component": "Logo"
  }
```

For now this block does not have any required or optional blocks.

#### Configuration

Through the Storefront, you can change the `Logo`'s behavior and interface. However, you also can make in your theme app, as Store theme does.
