## Usage
To import a component of this project follow the instructions below. 

You need to add into the dependencies of your `manifest.json` and use it like a npm module. 
```json 
"dependencies": {
  "vtex.store-components": "1.x"
}
```

And to import it into your code, for example: 
```js
import ProductPrice from 'vtex.store-components/ProductPrice'
```

## Creating a new component
To start your development, create a new folder on react/components. Thats where your source code will be stored. Also create a new js file on /react, this file should be used to expose your component, like:


### Project structure 
Inside your `react/components/<component_name>` you should have:

- index.js
- README.md
- components/ [Optional]
- constants/  [Optional]
- utils/      [Optional]
- queries/    [Optional]
- mutations/  [Optional]
- global.css  [Optional]

Next, inside of `react/` folder you need to export your component, such as: 

```js
import ProductPrice from './components/ProductPrice/index'

export default ProductPrice
```

### Working on your index.js

All the css needed and used on the component should be inside of a global.css and it should be imported by the index.js file like:

```js
import './global.css'
```

All dependencies needed should be inserted inside the react/package.json

## Testing

To test your code you should run on your workspace:

```sh
vtex link
```
