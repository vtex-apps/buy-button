# NPM store components

## Description

Npm-storecomponents is a collection of components that can be used to create/extend others vtex components. This repo used `lerna` to manage the npm packages. More info: https://lernajs.io/

## Continuous Integrations 

### Travis CI 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vtex-apps/npm-storecomponents.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vtex-apps/npm-storecomponents)

## Setup

```sh
npm i -g lerna

git clone git@github.com:vtex-apps/npm-storecomponents.git

cd npm-storecomponents

yarn i
```

Now you are ready to start writing some code. You can either implement a new module or extend an existing one.

## Creating a new module

To create a new module you should create a npm package inside the folder `packages`. You can start by:

```sh
## on root folder: npm-storecomponents

mkdir packages/<your-npm-module>
cd packages/<your-npm-module>
npm init
mkdir src  ## your source code should go in here
mkdir docs ## this is not required but we strongly recommend you write your own docs.
vim src/index.js ## this is the entry point of your module
```

Next, you need to work on your moduleÂ´s `package.json`

It should look like this:

```javascript
{
  "name": "@vtex/<your-npm-module>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "<your-npm-module description>",
  "main": "dist/index.js", // your code will be compiled and added to this file.
  "files": [
    "dist/"
  ],
  "scripts": { // common functions that all packages should have
    "test": "vtex-scripts test",
    "start": "webpack --watch",
    "build": "vtex-scripts build"
  },
  "author": "VTEX",
  "license": "ISC",
  "peerDependencies": {  // this will vary depending on your needs
    "prop-types": "~15.6.1",
    "react": "~15.5.4",
    "react-dom": "~15.5.4"
  },
  "directories": { // this should be common to all packages
    "doc": "docs",
    "dist": "dist"
  },
  "devDependencies": { // this should be common to all packages
    "@vtex/vtex-scripts": "^0.4.2",
    "enzyme": "^3.3.0",
    "enzyme-adapter-react-16": "^1.1.1",
    "webpack": "^4.6.0",
    "webpack-cli": "^2.0.14"
  }
}
```

### Working on your src/index.js

As we said before, this is the entry point that the webpack will be looking into, so if you have more than one source file you should use this file to export the others. Like:

```javascript
// packages/slick-components/src/index.js

export * from './Arrow'
export * from './Dots'
```

In this case we exported two components, but you can go on as you please. On the components that are being exported you shouldn't use `export default`, instead you should use named exports like:

```javascript
// packages/slick-components/src/Dots.js

export class Dots extends Component {}
```

## Publishing to npm

To publish a package is simple. First of, you should configure your npm with your own account info and set the scope to vtex, because we are working with scoped packages. More info: https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope

```sh
npm login --scope=@vtex
```

Once you get that out of the way you that are two primary cases that you should pay attention:

* If it is a new package, you should go to the package folder and publish it with access set to public. Like:

```sh
   ## on root folder of your package: npm-storecomponents/packages/<your-npm-module>
   npm publish --access=public
```

* If it is an existent package:

```sh
   ## any where on: npm-storecomponents
   lerna publish
```

## Testing your package without publishing it

To test your package you should use npm link. More info: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link

* First you should build your package

```sh
   ## on root folder of your package: npm-storecomponents/packages/<your-npm-module>
   npm run build
```

* After that you can link and use your package locally using npm install.
